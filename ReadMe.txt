I added a blank Unity project just to save time during the exam. There is nothing but an empty assets folder.

Part 1: I tried recreating the game in 3D and made the bump in Blender.

Part 2: First I set up the custom shader in Unity, added the base color and made the color ramp a texture. Made the output just the color modified by the toon lighting.

Part 3: 

Part 4: I tried adding the Rim light to the toon shader as a way to add more depth to the track but it looked weird so I just put it on the back floating parts as a demontration.
Added rim color and rim power to properties, added them as floats too and added emission to surface output.
